# Summer-Research-Python
A collection of python files and classes created for my data analysis during my internship at Boston University's Cognition and Decision Lab. Here is a short description of each file:

1) Pupil_avg: A python class with functions to aggregate, graph and perform multiple other operations on a pupillometry data set from a spatial prediction psychology experiment.

2) Gaze_corrector: A python class to collect pupil diameter data, gaze position coordinates along with other data from the experiment's csv files outputed by the eye-tracker. The file also includes functions that splice and segment the data and put it into a usable format(mostly numpy arrays and pandas dataframes). This is essentially a collection of data preprocessing tools.
